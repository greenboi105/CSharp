# C# Web API Project Notes

In a typical C# Web API project, you will find several files and folders that are essential for organizing and building the project.

1. Program.cs: The file contains the entry point of the web application. It sets up the web host and configures various services and middleware.

2. Startup.cs: The file is responsible for configuring the application's services and middleware pipeline. It includes methods such as 'ConfigureServices' for registering dependencies and 'Configure' for configuring request handling pipeline.

3. appsettings.json: This JSON file contains configuration settings for the web application. It can include connection strings, logging configurations, API keys, and other application-specific settings.

4. Controllers folder: This folder contains the API controllers that define the endpoints and handle incoming HTTP requests. Each controller typically corresponds to a specific resource or business functionality.

5. Models folder: This folder typically contains the data models or classes that represent the entities or objects used in the API. These models define the structure of the data transferred between the client and the API.

6. Startup.cs: This file is responsible for configuring the application's services and middleware pipeline. It includes methods such as ConfigureServices for registering dependencies and Configure for configuring request handling pipeline.

7. wwwroot folder: This folder is the web root and contains static files such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other client-side assets.

8. wwwroot/index.html: A default HTML file that is served as the landing page when accessing the root URL of the web application.

9. Views folder (optional): If you are using a view engine like Razor, this folder contains the views or templates that define the HTML structure and layout for rendering dynamic content.

10. appsettings.Development.json (optional): This file contains configuration settings specific to the development environment. It overrides or extends the settings in the appsettings.json file.

11. appsettings.Production.json (optional): This file contains configuration settings specific to the production environment. It overrides or extends the settings in the appsettings.json file.

12. Other files and folders: Depending on your project's requirements and additional libraries or frameworks used, you may have additional files and folders for things like authentication settings, dependency injection configuration, logging configuration, and more.
